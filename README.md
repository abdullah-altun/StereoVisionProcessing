This project is a Python library developed for reading images from a ZED stereo camera, processing the images, and matching them. It includes essential stereo image processing functions such as camera calibration, stereo matching, and depth map generation. Using the ZED stereo camera, it provides a starting point for 3D modeling and depth perception projects.
